Play this pack on a superflat default world type, this will follow perfectly towards progression\n\n3. This is a tutorial series(Kinda) on Gregtech Community Editon Unnofficial, this is not my mod and this pack was built off of their community pack. §6§§This pack is made for pure §fprogression towards gregtech and having fun while doing so. Also thier may be some foul langauge every now and again since I get mad. Sorry...\n\n4. This pack has no required exploration or mining, all resources will be able to be collected skyblock style.\n\n5. Have fun!! If you don\u0027t than I will refuse to give you any questbook rewards.",

I am not joking you, the rumors are true, this pack does have veinminer (But just for trees as of right now).\n\nGo and craft up a gregtech axe if you want a faster way to mine down wood, I will even give you 4 spruce sapling to give you a huge boost in log production.\n\n-Sadly ): the axe is going to require a little more info for crafting it. U will need to craft up a file which require 2 plates of a metel. What is a plate you ask? If you check JEI it is 2 ingots smashed together with the hammer u should have crafted by now. Once u have the file u can easily craft yourself an axe which requires 2 plates and 1 ingot to craft up",

The macerator would take forever + you don\u0027t get any byproducts from it yet so try to be effective with your time. \n\nLets do some practice with some Copper ore!",

Good for you! \n\nAs a reward, I will be giving you a second BBF for free!\n\nAlso check JEI for instructions on how to build the multiblock, this can be found by clicking on the Primitive Blast furnace block in JEI.\n\n*Note: Some Gregtech multiblocks can share walls with eachother, this means that you can have two BBF share the walls with each other resulting in less resources used for another one, you can actually make a 2x2 BBF array with each consecutive furance being cheaper than the last one. Two should be enough to suffice for now though. \n\n**Oh and by the way, if you ever want to make more of these, I assure you to check JEI, there may/maynot be an easier way of crafting up blast bricks.\n\n",

Luckily with the steam machines, you will not loose any inputs and the multiblock will not start until it has enough steam to process whatever material is put in.\n\nThis means that the machines will just wait until it has enough steam till it operates, so be patient.\n\nThe steam furnace will require §c2000L §fof steam to perform one operation.

But more on §eglue §fAFTER you craft up the machine, right now you need to be focusing on making the machine other than how to use the machine.\n\nIF YOU ARE HERE FOR THE GAS COLLECTOR:\n\nThis machine can seperate air to Nitrogen and Oxygen, but first I would reccomend you make another centrifuge.\nI know that may sound annoying, but you will need to allocate another one to deal with all of the fluid hodge-podge, while not required (Most of this chapter isn\u0027t anyways) This will improve your QOL.\n\nAlso I would imput fluid DIRECTLY to your §bcentrifuge §fthis will require less manual work, and let the machines do the work for you.\n\nU can directly imput fluids, by pressing the §9Fluid auto output arrow §fon your §1gas collector§f, and rotate the output hatch with the §9blue square §faround it, make sure this hatch is touching your §bcentrifuge§f, so that fluid gets imputed directly to the §bcentrifuge§f.\n",
